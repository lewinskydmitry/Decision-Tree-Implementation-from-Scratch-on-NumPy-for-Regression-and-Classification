# Decision Tree Implementation for Regression and Classification

This repository contains code for implementing decision trees from scratch using NumPy for regression and classification tasks.
Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm that is often used for data classification and prediction tasks.
This implementation allows you to create decision trees without relying on external libraries.

The code contains implementations for both regression and classification tasks. 
It includes functions for creating decision trees, splitting data, and making predictions.
The repository also includes examples of how to use the code on various datasets and how to visualize the resulting decision trees.
